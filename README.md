# Word-Guessing-Game
A guessing game using JavaScript related words! The word to guess is chosen from an array, incremented each 'round'. There is a score system, and a progress bar to indicate how close you are to failure. The game (including score) is saved to localstorage, so that when you return, the score and word to guess do not reset.
